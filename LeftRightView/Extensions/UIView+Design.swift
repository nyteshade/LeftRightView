extension UIView {
  /**
    The problem with UIView.animate and UIView.animateKeyFrames is that
    they do not allow for code to be executed between each sequenced
    animation. Due to the way that most of the basic animation libraries
    work, there is a contrived limit to the number of linked animations
    that can be performed.

    This extension allows up to four animations and completion blocks to
    be chained in order. The first has to complete before the second
    starts, and so on.

    - Parameters:
      - duration1: the `TimeInterval` length of the animation for animation 1
      - options1: the `UIView.AnimationOptions` for animation 1
      - animation1: the final state afte the animation is complete for anim 1
      - completion1: the code to execute after animation 1 is complete
      - duration2: the `TimeInterval` length of the animation for animation 2
      - options2: the `UIView.AnimationOptions` for animation 2
      - animation2: the final state afte the animation is complete for anim 2
      - completion2: the code to execute after animation 2 is complete
      - duration3: the `TimeInterval` length of the animation for animation 3
      - options3: the `UIView.AnimationOptions` for animation 3
      - animation3: the final state afte the animation is complete for anim 3
      - completion3: the code to execute after animation 3 is complete
      - duration4: the `TimeInterval` length of the animation for animation 4
      - options4: the `UIView.AnimationOptions` for animation 4
      - animation4: the final state afte the animation is complete for anim 4
      - completion4: the code to execute after animation 4 is complete
